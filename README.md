## Objective
To create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore Akshay Kumar's movies from 2000 to 2022, filtered by IMDb ratings, vote counts, genre, billing rank, and year of release. The goal is to visually analyze trends in the actor’s film performance and popularity.

## Challenge Context
This project was developed as part of Tableau’s #DataPlusMovies Challenge, focusing on showcasing creativity and insight through visual storytelling using movie data.

## Methodology
Data Source: Tableau
Data Points Visualized:

IMDb Ratings

IMDb Votes

Year of Release

Genre

Billing Rank (1–12)

## Tool Used: Tableau

##  Techniques:

Implemented action filters for interactive highlighting based on selected criteria.

Designed an intuitive single-page layout optimized for quick exploration.

## Features and Interactivity
Genres are color-coded (e.g., Comedy, Action, Drama, etc.) for easier visual grouping.

Users can highlight movies based on:

IMDb rating thresholds (2+ to 8+)

Vote ranges (0+ to 70k+)

Year of release (histogram filter)

Billing rank in credits

Star icons display the IMDb rating for each movie, providing quick comparison at a glance.

## Key Insights
Akshay Kumar has acted in a diverse range of genres, with Comedy and Action dominating.

Several of his movies have achieved ratings above 8.0, indicating strong audience appreciation.

A noticeable cluster of lower-rated films exists in the mid-2010s, suggesting a dip in critical reception during that period.

User interactivity makes it easy to identify high-rated movies with substantial audience votes or sort by specific years.

## Result
The dashboard successfully allows users to visually explore Akshay Kumar’s career performance across two decades. It provides fans, analysts, or data enthusiasts with a powerful tool to filter and discover his most (or least) acclaimed works based on different parameters.
